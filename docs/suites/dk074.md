| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 19501101T0000Z | coupled crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s-1". Have shortened timestep and resubmitted - next coupled held. Coupled crashed again - will have to roll back another month... UPDATE:- the previous coupled step and the current one both ran successfully - settings reset and job released | 2024-11-02 |
| 19510901T0000Z | coupled crashed in atmosphere - perturbing dump and will resubmit | 2024-11-08 |
| 19520901T0000Z | coupled crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s-1". Have shortened timestep and resubmitted - next coupled held. UPDATE:- coupled ran successfully - timestep reset and next coupled released. | 2024-11-11 |
| 19521101T0000Z | coupled crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s-1". Have shortened timestep and resubmitted - next coupled held. Crashed again so will have to roll back to the previous month... UPDATE:- 19511001T0000Z and 19521101T0000Z have both successfully run. Releasing suite | 2024-11-12 |
| 19570101T0000Z | coupled crashed in CICE - shortened timestep and resubmitted. UPDATE 2024-11-22. Job crashed again (in NEMO this time) and so I will roll back to the previous month... UPDATE 2024-11-24: both jobs have run successfully. Settings reset and the job has been released. | 2024-11-21 |
| 19610101T0000Z | coupled crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s-1". Shorterned timeste and resubmitted. UPDATE:- crashed again, will have to roll back. Ran successfully through the two months, but accidently triggered JDMA for 19610101T0000Z before the data had been transfered, and housekeeping also ran... So had to roll back to 19601201T0000Z again and rerun both months.| 2024-12-3 |
| 19650201T0000Z | coupled crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s-1". Shorterned timeste and resubmitted. Coupled ran successfully - so timestep changed back. Updated clock to 5 hours as have had a couple of time-outs. Suite released again... | 2024-12-19 |
| 19660101T0000Z | coupled crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s-1". Shorterned timeste and resubmitted. | 2024-12-21 |
