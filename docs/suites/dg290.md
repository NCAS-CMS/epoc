| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
|19550101T0000Z| NEMO crashed with stp_ctl:tracer anomaly: sea surface temperature > 40C Attempting atmosphere perturbation in 195501 atmosphere dump. This failed. Now attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 1 cycle. | 19/07/2024 |
|19570201T0000Z| NEMO crashed with  stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s : Attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 1 cycle | 18/08/2024|
|19570201T0000Z| Previous fix failed. Rolled back to 19570101T0000Z and restarted with 3 min timestep for 2 cycles. 19570201T0000Z completed successfully. Reverted to 5min time step for following cycles. Replaced old JDMA 195701 with new 195701 | 21/08/2024|
|19580101T0000Z| NEMO crashed with  stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s : Attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 1 cycle | 02/09/2024|
|19580101T0000Z| Previous fix failed. Rolled back to 19571201T0000Z and restarted with 3 min timestep for 2 cycles. 19580101T0000Z completed successfully. Reverted to 5min time step for following cycles. JDMA held so no need to replace 195712 on ET | 06/09/2024|
|19580301T0000Z| CICE crashed ice: Vertical thermo error - reduced ocean time step, restarted - cycle ran OK. reverted to 5min time step for following cycles.  | 06/09/2024| 
|19594101T0000Z| NEMO crashed with  stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s : Attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 2 cycles. Reverted to 5min following this | 09/09/2024|
|19610201T0000Z| NEMO crashed with  stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s : Attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 2 cycles.  | 13/09/2024|
|19610201T0000Z| Previous fix failed. Rolled back to 19610101T0000Z and restarted with 3 min timestep for 2 cycles. Reverted to 5 min timestep for following cycles| 13/09/2024| 
|19620101T0000Z| Failed because ozone data was deleted from NVme scratch before it could be used. Rebuilt the .po ozone file from archived .p4 ozone files using /work/n02/n02/lrdlrh/EPOC/restarts/HH_4xCO2/u-dg290/1961/concat_po.sh redistribute_ozone accepted this and coupled ran OK. Ozone outputs look sensible | 08/11/2024|
|19630701T0000Z| North/South halos too small for advection. Attempting to perturb the atmosphere dump | 11/11/2024|
|19631001T0000Z| North/South halos too small for advection. Attempting to perturb the atmosphere dump | 12/11/2024|
