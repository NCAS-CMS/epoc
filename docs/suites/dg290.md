| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 19550101T0000Z | NEMO crashed with stp_ctl:tracer anomaly: sea surface temperature > 40C Attempting atmosphere perturbation in 195501 atmosphere dump. This failed. Now attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 1 cycle. | 19/07/2024 |
|19570201T0000Z| NEMO crashed with  stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s : Attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 1 cycle | 18/08/2024|
|19570201T0000Z|  Previous fix failed. Rolled back to 19570101T0000Z and restarted with 3 min timestep for 2 cycles. 19570201T0000Z completed successfully. Reverted to 5min time step for following cycles. Replaced old JDMA 195701 with new 195701 | 21/08/2024|
|19580101T0000Z| NEMO crashed with  stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s : Attempting to change the Ocean Timestep to 3min for 1 cycle | 02/09/2024|
|19580101T0000Z|  Previous fix failed. Rolled back to 19571201T0000Z and restarted with 3 min timestep for 2 cycles. 19580101T0000Z completed successfully. Reverted to 5min time step for following cycles. JDMA held so no need to replace 195712 on ET | 06/09/2024|
|19580301T0000Z| CICE crashed ice: Vertical thermo error - reduced ocean time step, restarted - cycle ran OK. reverted to 5min time step for following cycles.  | 06/09/2024|
