| 19560201 | Crashed in CICE - shortened timestep and restarted. Crashed again in NEMO - will roll back and perturb atmosphere. Crashed again in NEMO in 19560101... decided to re-perturb the atmosphere and re-run 19560101 and it ran successfully... currently re-running 19560201 and working through steps in the previous cycle... 19560201 has crashed in NEMO again. I will perturb the atmosphere and try 19560201 again with a 2min time-step in NEMO. To do this I copied the opt file from Annette's u-dp361. 19560201 coupled ran successfully with the 2min time-step. Settings set back to normal and job released...  | 2025-08-27 |
