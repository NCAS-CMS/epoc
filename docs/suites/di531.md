| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 19530901T0000Z| model may have crashed in coupled. Accidently restarted from the begining. Warm start in same cycle, and coupled ran successfully... Ozone redistribution worked fine and the run has been released | 2024-08-20 |
| 19541201T0000Z | model crashed in NEMO - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time-step and ran successfully. Timestep etc returned to normal and suite released | 2024-08-26 |
| 19551001T0000Z | model crashed in NEMO - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step but failed again. Therefore went back to previous cycle 19550901T0000Z and re-ran that and 19551001T0000Z with the shorterned time step. Both have completed successfully. 19550901T0000Z cycle data was removed from JDMA, and new cycles have been uploaded.  | 2024-09-01 |
| 19570101T0000Z | model crashed in NEMO - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step. Cycle with shorterned timestep ran fine. Settings back to normal and model has been released | 2024-09-07 |
| 19570401T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step. Simulation ran OK, but I forgot to hold the run. It ran until 19570601T0000Z with 3 minute time-step. Time step was set back to normal for 19570701T0000Z | 2024-09-08 |
