| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 19530901T0000Z| model may have crashed in coupled. Accidently restarted from the begining. Warm start in same cycle, and coupled ran successfully... Ozone redistribution worked fine and the run has been released | 2024-08-20 |
| 19541201T0000Z | model crashed in NEMO - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time-step and ran successfully. Timestep etc returned to normal and suite released | 2024-08-26 |
| 19551001T0000Z | model crashed in NEMO - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step but failed again. Therefore went back to previous cycle 19550901T0000Z and re-ran that and 19551001T0000Z with the shorterned time step. Both have completed successfully. 19550901T0000Z cycle data was removed from JDMA, and new cycles have been uploaded.  | 2024-09-01 |
| 19570101T0000Z | model crashed in NEMO - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step. Cycle with shorterned timestep ran fine. Settings back to normal and model has been released | 2024-09-07 |
| 19570401T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step. Simulation ran OK, but I forgot to hold the run. It ran until 19570601T0000Z with 3 minute time-step. Time step was set back to normal for 19570701T0000Z | 2024-09-08 |
| 19600701T0000Z | crash in coupled. Seems to be memory error (e.g., Address not mapped to object). Resubmitted as is. | 2024-09-15 |
| 19630101T0000Z | crash in coupled - NEMO error "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cycle resubmitted with shorterned time step. Coupled ran successfully, but forgot to hold the next coupled again. Also ran 19630201T0000Z with 3 minute time step before being set back to normal | 2024-09-20 |
| 19640101T0000Z | model crashed due to node error - resubmitted | 2024-09-22 |
| 19640201T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cycle resubmitted with shorterned timestep (and next coupled held!). Job ran successfully. Settings set back to normal and suite released. | 2024-09-23 |
| 19660101T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cylce resubmitted with shorterned timestep and next coupled held. job re-ran fine and settings set back to normal. | 2024-09-30 |
| 19680101T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cylce resubmitted with shorterned timestep and next coupled held. Model crashed again. Will roll back to previous month (19671201T0000Z) and try again with 3m timestep. 19671201T0000Z ran successfully. I reran the Ozone redistribution tasks, and have retriggered 19680101T0000Z. However, I had not re-run the post-proc, and so will have used the previously computed Ozone ancil. Given the small differences expected, we continued with the run | 2024-10-07 |
| 19690201T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cylce resubmitted with shorterned timestep and next coupled held. Job ran successfully so settings set back to normal and suite released. | 2024-10-13 |
| 19720101T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cylce resubmitted with shorterned timestep and next coupled held. | 2024-10-20 |
| 19740801T0000Z | Coupled job step crashed due to node error - resubmitted as is | 2024-10-28 |
| 19750801T0000Z | Model crashed in NEMO "stpctl: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s" - cylce resubmitted with shorterned timestep. Ran successfully - but forgot to hold next cycle (19750901T0000Z), which also ran. Settings put back to normal and continued | 2024-10-30 |
