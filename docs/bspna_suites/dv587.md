| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 195010 | Crash in NEMO (like in u-du815) - I will change timestep to 2 mins and perturb the atmosphere to set this on a different track to du815. Ran fine, but I forgot to hold the next coupled so 195011 also ran with a 2min timestep | 2025 - 12 - 18 |
| 195212 | Crash in NEMO - changed ts to 2min and resubmittd. crashed again - will perturb atmosphere and resubmit. Crashed again. Rolled back to 195211 - copied NEMOhist and CICEhist to make sure we have backups of starts.  | 2025 - 12 - 29 |

Have successfully re-run 195610 and 195611 with 2min ts, and have re-run all the other jobs in the 195610 cycle (up to JDMA), and have reset back to normal and released | 2026 - 1 - 15 |
