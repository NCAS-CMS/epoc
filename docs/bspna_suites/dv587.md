| Cycle | Description | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 195010 | Crash in NEMO (like in u-du815) - I will change timestep to 2 mins and perturb the atmosphere to set this on a different track to du815. Ran fine, but I forgot to hold the next coupled so 195011 also ran with a 2min timestep | 2025 - 12 - 18 |
| 195212 | Crash in NEMO - changed ts to 2min and resubmittd | 2025 - 12 - 29 |
