|19541001T0000Z| Ocean crash: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s - Attemtping to reduce time step for 1 cycle| 15 Dec 2025|
|19541001T0000Z| 8 more attempts at this cycle, but just keeps hanging, even with 12H submission time. Now anorther Ocean crash: the zonal velocity is larger than 20 m/s - Attemtping to reduce time step for 1 cycle againand 4H submit| 23 Dec 2025|
|19541001T0000Z| A futher attempt with 3min timesetep times out with 4H near the same Atm timestep. Attempting to perturb the Atmosphere and rerun| 24 Dec 2025|
|19541001T0000Z| Many more time outs. Attempting a 2min ocean timestep for 12H | 07 jan 2026|
